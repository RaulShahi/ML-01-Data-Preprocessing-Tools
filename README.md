# ML-01-Data-Preprocessing-Tools
This project implements a simple but the most essential part of any ML application i.e. **Data Preprocessing** using the **Scikit Learn** library.

## Overview

Data Preprocessing is the first step for Machine Learning. It is very important that we clean the data beforehand so that the model we will build later is not affected with random noises present in the data.   
In this project:

- A csv file is read using **Pandas**
- **Missing Data** are handled. 
- **Categorical Data** are encoded.
- Data is split into **train and test** parts.
- **Feature Scaling** is applied to avoid erroneous conclusions because of scale variances in the input data.
